# RestTestPryata2.0

**Things I did better**

Instead of making my own funtions I used Java 8's Collectors, which is used after stream. I only made a function to parse the json arrays

I also tried to loop through the pages instead of using the page all 

**Required**

Java 11 or above I used open JDK 17.0.2

 add a Maven JSON dependency (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20211205)
 
to test the unit tests you will need the dependency for JUnit 5.8.1

**Installation instructions**

Download the code from github, make sure you have the dependency and Java 11 or above and then go to main.java run it
